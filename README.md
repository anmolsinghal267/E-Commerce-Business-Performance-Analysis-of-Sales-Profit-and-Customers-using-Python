# E-Commerce Business Performance Analysis of Sales,Profit and Customers using Python

##  Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce company’s sales, profit, and customer data using Python, with the aim of understanding how the business is performing and where improvements can be made. The analysis is designed from a Business Analyst perspective, where raw transaction data is converted into meaningful insights that can help management take better decisions.

The project evaluates key areas such as overall sales and profit trends, product category performance, the impact of discounts on profitability, customer buying behavior, and regional as well as city-level performance. By identifying high-performing areas along with loss-making or low-margin segments, the analysis highlights opportunities for revenue growth, cost control, and pricing optimization.

In addition, the project studies customer segments and top customers to understand loyalty patterns and repeat purchasing behavior, which are critical for customer retention strategies in the e-commerce industry. Overall, this project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to support business planning, improve profitability, and strengthen decision-making in a real-world e-commerce environment.

##  Objectives

- To evaluate overall sales and profit performance of the e-commerce business.
- To identify high-performing and underperforming product categories and sub-categories.

## Business Conclusions drawn from each Problem Statement


|Problem | Conclusions |
|---------------|-------------|
|  **Problem 1** | Minimum Sales is in February and Maximum Sales is in November-Sales exhibit a fluctuating monthly trend with a clear acceleration in the second half of the year, peaking around months 9 and 11, which suggests strong seasonality and higher demand during the later periods.  |
|  **Problem 2** | Technology emerges as the highest-contributing category (36.4%), while Furniture (32.3%) and Office Supplies (31.3%) show closely aligned performance, indicating a balanced product portfolio with technology acting as the key revenue and growth lever. |
|  **Problem 3** | Sales are heavily driven by a few high-performing sub-categories—particularly Phones and Chairs—while several others show moderate to low contribution|
|  **Problem 4** |Monthly profit shows short-term volatility but a clear upward trajectory toward year-end, indicating improving margins and stronger profitability in the latter months.|
|  **Problem 5** |Profit contribution is dominated by Technology (50.8%), followed by Office Supplies (42.8%), while Furniture contributes minimally (6.4%), indicating significant margin concentration in technology-driven products.|
|  **Problem 6** |Profitability varies significantly across sub-categories, with Copiers, Phones, Accessories, and Paper generating strong positive margins, while Tables and Bookcases incur losses, highlighting clear margin asymmetry and the need for sub-category–level pricing and cost optimization.|
|  **Problem 7** |The Consumer segment drives the highest sales and profit, followed by Corporate, while Home Office contributes the least, indicating that overall profitability is strongly volume-led and concentrated in consumer-driven demand.|
|  **Problem 8** |The Consumer segment shows the highest sales-to-profit ratio, indicating lower profit efficiency per unit of sales, while Corporate and Home Office convert sales into profit more efficiently, with Home Office demonstrating the strongest relative margin performance.|
|  **Problem 9** |Standard Class is the most frequently used shipping mode by a wide margin, indicating a strong preference for cost-effective delivery, while Same Day is least utilized, reflecting limited demand for premium, expedited shipping options. |
|  **Problem 10** |Standard Class is the most frequently used shipping mode by a wide margin, indicating a strong preference for cost-effective delivery, while Same Day is least utilized, reflecting limited demand for premium, expedited shipping options.|
|  **Problem 11** | Among the top 10 cities, New York City generates the highest sales by a clear margin, followed by Los Angeles and Seattle, while the remaining cities show progressively lower but consistent sales contributions.|
|  **Problem 12** |The bottom 10 cities contribute very low sales overall, with Missouri City and Keller performing slightly better than the rest, while cities like Abilene and Elyria show minimal sales, indicating limited market presence and potential areas for targeted growth or cost rationalization. |
|  **Problem 13** | Among the top five profit-generating cities, New York City leads by a significant margin, followed by Los Angeles and Seattle, while San Francisco and Detroit contribute comparatively lower but still substantial profits. |
|  **Problem 14** |These top five customers place the highest number of orders, indicating strong loyalty and repeat purchasing behavior, and they represent ideal candidates for targeted rewards such as exclusive discounts, loyalty programs, or personalized offers to further strengthen retention and lifetime value. |
|  **Problem 15** |Sales and profit show a clear year-on-year upward trend, with steady growth from 2014 to 2017, indicating improving business performance, increasing market demand, and better cost and margin management over time.|

## Key Business Insights

#### 1. Strong Seasonality Drives Revenue Growth
- Sales and profit are lowest in the early months and peak toward year-end.

- November shows the highest demand, indicating strong seasonal influence.

- Total Quantity Sold is 7,523 units, meaning fewer units sold at higher price points (indicating a higher-end strategy).

####  2. Technology Is the Primary Revenue and Profit Engine
- Technology contributes the highest share of total sales and profit.

- Margins in Technology are significantly higher than other categories.

- Continued focus on technology products can drive sustainable growth.

####  3. Sub-Category Margin Imbalance Requires Optimization
- Phones, Copiers, and Accessories generate strong positive margins.

- Tables and Bookcases consistently incur losses.
- Pricing, sourcing, or product mix optimization is required at sub-category level.

####  4. Consumer Segment Drives Volume but Not Efficiency
- Consumer segment generates the highest sales and profit volume.

- Profit per unit of sales is lower compared to Corporate and Home Office.

- Discount and pricing strategies should be refined for consumer customers.

####  5. Revenue and Profit Are Concentrated in Few Markets and Customers
- A small number of cities contribute a large share of total sales and profit.

- Top customers place frequent repeat orders, showing high loyalty.

- Geographic and customer base diversification can reduce concentration risk.


## Strategic Recommendations
- Strengthen inventory planning and marketing campaigns during high-demand months to fully leverage seasonal sales peaks.

- Prioritize Technology products in assortment planning and promotions to sustain revenue and profit growth.

- Review pricing, sourcing, and discount strategies for loss-making sub-categories to improve overall margins.
- Optimize discounting for the Consumer segment to improve profit efficiency without impacting sales volume.
- Diversify revenue across regions and customer segments to reduce dependency on top markets and customers.
- Expand presence in underperforming cities through targeted marketing or cost-effective channel strategies.
